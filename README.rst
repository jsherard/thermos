Fully functional (but modernized) App built as part of Reindert-Jan Ekker Introduction to the Flask Microframework on Pluralsight.

App is built in python 3.6 and with recent versions of all libraries with the exception Select2 which is still v3.5.1.

See requirements.txt for versions of all libraries.

NOTE: Tried to used most recent version of Select2, but that broke functionality, so I reverted back to V3.5.1.
